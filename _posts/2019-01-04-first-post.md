So, I recently thought of making a nice, new blog for recording my experiences
in recent programming contests, etc. I hope I would keep updating this blog so
that I could look back at my journey at some point of time.

Just checking if I could include code snippets here:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello world!";
  return 0;
}
```

And this, `print('Hello world')`.

What about this:
> This is some sentence

You should just print 'Hello world'.
