The results of GCI are supposed to be announced today at 22:30 IST but I&#39;m not that curious for the results since I have already blown up the chance of winning something.</p> <p>In GCI I was only able to complete 10 tasks which is far less than many of the other candidates. I still have 3 years left for GCI, hence I think I can get better eventually and finally have a go with the prize.</p> <p>This week was fun, the only thing I missed is the lack of coala maintainers. I&#39;m not able to contribute anything to coala currently since there are very few active maintainers and a lot of stuff is dependent upon them. I think the maintainers specially <a href="https://github.com/jayvdb">jayvdb</a> should be free until next week.</p> <p>I participated in 3 contests in total.</p> <ol> <li><p>January Long Challenge &#40;ongoing&#41;</p> <li><p>Hello 2019</p> <li><p>Codeforces Round 530 Div. 2</p> </ol> <p>All three of them were very good. I started to realize that I make big mistakes, and most of the times I miss some of the required points in the problem. I have pushed the solutions to both of the Codeforces contests on Github.</p> <p>I still need to solve more problems, specially harder ones, that is the only way I can get better with problem solving.</p> <p>I will post the discussion for the long contest in the upcoming blog post.</p> <p>Keep smiling ðŸ˜„</p> </div> </main> </div> <footer> &copy; Abhinav Kaushlya.
